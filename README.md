# osx-ruby-bridge

Bare minimum bridging for MRI to easily use Cocoa objects. The intended
use for this code is to be included as a submodule in C extensions that
require some bridging.

This was extracted from the [accessibility-core](https://github.com/ferrous26/accessibility-core)
project and is a work-in-progress.
